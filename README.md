# 🪨 Stone Sage

A work-in-progress regression project using PyTorch and a small tabular dataset.  
The goal is to build a modular, lightweight pipeline for exploring and training neural networks on structured numerical data.

🔧 Currently implementing:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Custom logging and metrics

📍 Status: **Work in Progress** – still refining architecture, experiments, and documentation.  
Stay tuned for updates!
